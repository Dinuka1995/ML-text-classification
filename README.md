# ML-text-classification

This is a simple project which classify the news articles into 2 different classes.

The training sets and a data set without labels were provided and what i have done is first preprocessed the data set and extracted the 
feature matrix and using count vectorizer counts the number of times that each word apear on a news line. Then using that data a classifier 
was trained and tested. 
Then predicted the classes for un labeled dataset.
